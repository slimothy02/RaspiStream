# RaspiStream
Flask program that streams video from a webcam onto a website

------------------------------------------------------------ RASPBERRRY PI GUIDE --------------------------------------------------------

Using the Raspi:

In order to program the raspberry pi WITHOUT a monitor, you must use SSH. This connects to the raspi over the network and allows usage
on a seperate computer.

In order to use SSH, open PowerShell on your desktop. Type in the command: "ssh username@raspi.local". This will prompt you for the 
raspi's password. I set the password to "password". The letters will not show up as you type them, this is normal.

From here you are given access to the raspi's terminal, allowing you full control over the raspi.

To view the files/folders contained in your location, type "ls".
To switch your location folder, type "cd (foldername)".
To edit or create a new file, type "nano (filename)".
If you need higher permissions to do something, add the word "sudo" to the beginning of the command (ie. "sudo nano myfile.txt")
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
---> WHEN SHUTTING DOWN, TYPE "sudo shutdown now". DO NOT UNPLUG THE RASPI WITHOUT DOING THIS (or pressing the shutdown button)  <----
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUnning the Program:

In order to run the website, make sure you are in the home directory by typing "cd ~". Then, type this command:
"flask --app streamWebsite run --host=0.0.0.0"
   where:
'streamWebsite' is the program name.
'run' tells Flask to run the program.
'--host=0.0.0.0' tells Flask to run the website on the whole network. (most important part)


The program that runs the webcam and uploads it to a website is listed as "streamWebsite.py". It is a python3 program. You can edit
it with the command "nano streamWebsite.py"

The Flask library in order to run the website. Flask uses the HTML file "templates/index.html" as the building block for the website. 
This library is confusing to use because it makes programming much different than you're used to with Python
The documentation for Flask can be found here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/

The Picamera2 and OpenCV libraries are used for the video processing. Picamera2 reads each invididual frame and OpenCV processes each
frame before being shown on the website.

Lastly the OS library is used to manipulate the files "infobox_.txt", which store the text on the announcement boxes.

Reconfiguring a new Raspberry Pi:

If the raspi gets corrupted and a new one must be set up, follow these steps.

1. Setup a new raspberry pi using the official guide. Set the username as "username" and the password as "password" and
	be sure to enable SSH.
2. Insert a USB stick into the raspi that contains the backup files for 
3. Plug in the raspi, connect to the network, and SSH into it.
4. Run the command "sudo apt update"
5. Run the command "sudo apt install python3-opencv"
6. Run the command "cd /media/username/'USB DRIVE'
7. Run the command "cp -r raspiBackup/* ~"   This copies the backup into the home directory.
8. Return to the home directory with "cd ~"

Now the raspi should be fully set up and good to use.
